Checklists and templates for basic projects

## Process

1. Determine the _type_ of project you wish to develop.
1. Develop a **checklist** (process) for that type of project.
1. Develop a **template** (boilerplate) for that type of project.

## Structure

- Each folder within this repo is a _type_ of project.
- Each type of project will have a `README.md` file that outlines the **checklist** (process) for developing that type of project.
- Each type of project will have an `index.html`, `index.css`, and `index.js` file that provides a starter **template** (boilerplate) for developing that type of project.
